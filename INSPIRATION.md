# 💡 Template Inspiration

This template was created based on **SLOVOR** - a real-world multilingual dictionary application that demonstrates all these principles in practice.

## Original Project

**SLOVOR** - Production-ready multilingual dictionary platform
- Repository: [Den3112/slovor](https://github.com/Den3112/slovor)
- Real-world implementation of all 8 principles
- 100x performance improvements through caching
- Complete infrastructure setup
- Comprehensive documentation

## What This Template Includes

This is a **distilled, reusable version** of SLOVOR's best practices:

✅ 8 Core Principles (from docs/PRINCIPLES.md in SLOVOR)
✅ Repository Pattern (from SLOVOR's data layer)
✅ Zustand State Management (from SLOVOR's store)
✅ Caching Strategy (100x performance from SLOVOR)
✅ ESLint Configuration (from SLOVOR)
✅ TypeScript Strict Mode (from SLOVOR)
✅ Error Handling Framework (from SLOVOR)
✅ API Patterns (from SLOVOR's routes)
✅ Component Patterns (extracted from SLOVOR)
✅ Documentation (adapted from SLOVOR)

## Use Cases

This template is perfect for:

- 🚀 **New Next.js Projects** - Start with best practices
- 🔄 **Refactoring Existing Code** - Use as reference architecture
- 📚 **Learning** - Understand clean code principles
- 👋 **Team Standards** - Establish consistent patterns
- 💫 **Code Reviews** - Reference implementation

## Key Differences from SLOVOR

### SLOVOR
- Specific domain (dictionary/language learning)
- WordPress backend integration
- User accounts and authentication
- Ad-supported model
- Production deployment setup

### This Template
- Generic, domain-agnostic
- Clean architecture basics only
- No authentication (add it yourself)
- Focus on code quality patterns
- Educational foundation

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Fork** this template
2. **Customize** for your domain
3. **Refer to SLOVOR** for production patterns
4. **Build something awesome**
